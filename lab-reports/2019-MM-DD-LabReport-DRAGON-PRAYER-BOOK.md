# Lab Report: DRAGON PRAYER BOOK

#### David Polansky

## Process Description

> You should begin with _1-2 paragraphs_ outlining precisely what you did in the lab activity. While much in these paragraphs will repeat between students, it is worthwhile to write out your experience, both to help you remember what you did and because your experiences—and what you take away or emphasize—will differ in subtle but important ways from your classmates. Most of our experiential activities will include specific outcomes. You might produce a specific material product, such as a letterpress printed sheet, or be asked to adapt code we went over together to answer a new question. The first task of any lab report, then, will be to demonstrate completion of these tasks.

First, we came to the archives and observed the Dragon Prayer Book (henceforth, DPB). We learned that it was made of 20 cows' worth of vellum, that it was used as a memory aid for prayers that the nuns using it already knew, and that the system of musical notation used within only had two keys - C and F.

Then, we worked on deciphering the DPB. This was incredibly difficult - many letters looked identical, abbreviations were used throughout, some of these abbreviations were ad-hoc, non-standard, or unknown to us, and none of us really knew enough Latin to verify if our translation was correct (without the help of the hosts of the workshop, who were indeed quite helpful).

Finally, we read aloud the prayer we deciphered, and the ghost of Sister Cynthia appeared behind a window at the back of the room. I shuddered - what horror had we unleashed?

## Observations

> In the next section of each report, you should in **2-3 paragraphs** move from a literal description of what you did in the lab to a more conceptual set of observations. In brief, you want to home in on those aspects of the lab that raised questions or prompted new insights into the textual technology we investigated in the lab activity. What new ideas occurred to you while working? What surprised, delighted, or frustrated you?

Made me think abt. use of abbr. in modern usage, esp. w/rt 140 char. tweets, txting, etc. (Ok, I'll stop.) While they may seem obvious once we know what they mean, there was a time when I didn't know what "lol" meant, and a moderately more recent time when I didn't know what something like "IANAL" meant. (Or something more obscure, like "TINACBNIEAC".) Without Google, I would've had to resort to asking people what they meant - or, more likely, just try to figure it out through context. If, as in the case of the DBP, there's nobody alive who used those abbreviations, you *have to* figure them out through context, which can be quite difficult.

The purpose of the DPB causes its inscrutability. Each snippet of a prayer or hymn was only meant to jog one's memory, so abbreviating and skipping words becomes very possible. Consider: "4 score +7ya fath brought forth ot cont, new nation..." which is only easy to decode because you know the Address. And this shorthand becomes *desirable* once you've committed to squeezing every prayer and hymn in a pocket-sized book made of vellum. 

(Inscrutability has more benefits than just brevity, but that's outside the scope.)


## Analysis

> The final section of each report should bring your work in the lab into direct, critical conversation with our readings. In **_3-4 paragraphs_**, you should connect your lab observations to ideas from readings assigned _in the given lab unit_. This prose need not be as formal as a research paper, but it should demonstrate careful thought and preparation. You should integrate the readings explicitly, if possible through direct quotation. Use this writing to experiment with intellectual pairings you think might be generative to your larger thinking and help you prepare for the class’ Unessay projects. Think of your lab reports as an evolving research paper, and take them as seriously as one.

In *What We Talk About When WE Talk About Books*, Price quotes David Mikics disapprovingly: "literature, music and art express; computers, by contrast, lead you in a step-by-step way." DPL is somewhere in between expression and enumeration: each fragment of prayer is merely a stepping stone to an unfragmented prayer; yet the actual prayers, Mikics might argue, are quite evocative. Speculation: prayer books like the DPB might also represent the midpoint between Bibles and indulgences in terms of production in the Renaissance. Consider that hymnals vastly outnumber Bibles in pews at modern Catholic churches. The DPB wasn't printed, so the number of DPBs produced was almost certainly much lower - one could imagine the Mother Superior carrying one of the few prayer books in the abbey.

The DPB could not have been entirely on the non-expressive, utilitarian side of the spectrum, not only because it was used for an expressive purpose, but also because it was illuminated. According to Borsuk, about 10% of 15th century manuscripts received illumination (51). While the DPB wasn't *as* illuminated as *The Book of Kells*, for example, the presence of illumination shows it was an important, valuable book. Borsuk says:

> The Book of Kells would have been an altar-book reserved for use during special services by a reader who had memorized the text. It was meant more to be seen and heard than studied, as evinced by a number of errors in the text including missing words, repeated passages, and illustrations added to cover up mistakes. (53)

DPB has some differences here also: the missing words in the DPB weren't errors, they were deliberate omissions; I'm not aware of any repeated passages; the only illustration in the book occurs on the title page. I don't think it's possible to determine precisely what role it had in the abbey without knowing more about its context - was it also reserved for special services, was it used only during Mass, or was it carried around daily? Like an abbreviation, most of the particulars are obscure - that is, until you consult someone who used it.
