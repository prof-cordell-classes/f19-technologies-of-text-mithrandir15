# Lab Report: BOOK BINDING

#### David Polansky

## Process Description

> You should begin with _1-2 paragraphs_ outlining precisely what you did in the lab activity. While much in these paragraphs will repeat between students, it is worthwhile to write out your experience, both to help you remember what you did and because your experiences—and what you take away or emphasize—will differ in subtle but important ways from your classmates. Most of our experiential activities will include specific outcomes. You might produce a specific material product, such as a letterpress printed sheet, or be asked to adapt code we went over together to answer a new question. The first task of any lab report, then, will be to demonstrate completion of these tasks.

We were each given three papers to bind: two papers of our printed poems, and one cover made of a thicker paper. The process to bind the books was:

1. Fold each paper in half with the bone folder - first curving the paper and making sure the edges lined up, then running the bone folder from the middle-edge to the center, from the center down, and from the center back up.
2. On each paper, mark the places where the thread will be inserted, using a ruler to make sure they're evenly spaced.
3. Line up the papers and place them on a cradle. Use an awl to stab the holes (not going straight down, but starting with the awl flat against one side of the paper and *then* turning it vertically - although I'm not sure if this is necessary).
4. Cut the thread so that it's 2.5 times the height of the paper.
5. Flatten the tip of the thread with the bone folder, then thread the needle.
6. Sew the thread through the holes (32124543).
7. Tie the thread together and chop any loose ends.

## Observations

> In the next section of each report, you should in **2-3 paragraphs** move from a literal description of what you did in the lab to a more conceptual set of observations. In brief, you want to home in on those aspects of the lab that raised questions or prompted new insights into the textual technology we investigated in the lab activity. What new ideas occurred to you while working? What surprised, delighted, or frustrated you?

Book binding was the final step in creating our books. I was surprisingly proud of my role in (almost) every part of the bookmaking process: composing, compositing, printing, and bookbinding. (Alas, I did not help make the paper.) As you noted, this bookbinding method can be used to create zines - that is, independent of any publisher. Together with the other processes, I could create a book with a much finer-grained control than usual. This is especially stark having just finished the dead media poster, which was simply three separate sheets of tabloid paper, printed digitally and not bound. Obviously this makes the work much quicker, but it feels less original [than it would otherwise], and there are certainly cases where a more involved process is worth it.

I became interested in how scalable this technique is. We only bound 3 pieces of paper: not including the covers, that's one 8-page book. (Some would probably say it's just a pamphlet, not a real book.) How efficient could it be if we were manufacturing hundreds of tiny books, and how effective would it be at creating a more medium-sized book? 

## Analysis

> The final section of each report should bring your work in the lab into direct, critical conversation with our readings. In **_3-4 paragraphs_**, you should connect your lab observations to ideas from readings assigned _in the given lab unit_. This prose need not be as formal as a research paper, but it should demonstrate careful thought and preparation. You should integrate the readings explicitly, if possible through direct quotation. Use this writing to experiment with intellectual pairings you think might be generative to your larger thinking and help you prepare for the class’ Unessay projects. Think of your lab reports as an evolving research paper, and take them as seriously as one.

In the chapter "Interleaf: Please Hold Flat", Price shows how a book's format can itself be an argument supporting its claim. She was claiming that the physicality of books, especially the posture in which we read them, inluences our comprehension and enjoyment. The format, of course, supported this thesis by making itself hard to read, impacting our comprehension. Binding books is essentially changing them from one format to another - from a collection of loose pages to an ordered series of bound pages. This has the logistical advantage of making the book smaller, easier to carry, and much easier to keep organized. But does it also impact meaning, or comprehension?

Binding a book makes the pages noticeably smaller, and Jane Austen has strong opinions about book size: 

> Ladies who read those enormous great stupid thick quarto volumes which one always sees in the breakfast parlour there must be acquainted with everything in the world. I detest a quarto. Capt. Pasley's book is too good for their society. They will not understand a man who condenses his thoughts into an octavo. - letter X

Without more context, it's difficult to determine exactly which kinds of books Austen associates with quartos and octavos. (Perhaps they tend to contain wholly different categories of genres, as do mass market paperbacks and trade paperbacks.) But it's reasonable to assume that the quartos contained much more *raw information* than the octavos ("condenses his thoughts") - and that Austen thought they were mostly for show. If the same dynamic applies to our tiny folio - well, our thoughts are *extra* condensed. Furthermore, since it's so short, we all must have read it, making it clearly not just for show. But also consider that Austen's second volume [of Pride and Prejudice] was shorter than she would have liked - she argues that "the difference is not so much in reality as in look" (letter VIII). While comprehension might not be impacted, the reader might wonder at the briefness of the book (and, as I remarked, might say that it's "not a real book."

In "Baxter's Procrustes", the narrator argues that the bookmaking choices strongly reflect the book's content:

> The dark green morocco, I said, in summing up, typified the author’s serious view of life, as a thing to be endured as patiently as might be. The cap-and-bells border was significant of the shams by which the optimist sought to delude himself into the view that life was a desirable thing. The intricate blind- tooling of the doublure shadowed forth the blind fate which left us in ignorance of our future and our past, or of even what the day itself might bring forth. - 790

But as the book in question had no content, we know that this passage was strongly satirical. While the intricate design of the cover and binding made Procrustes valuable to collectors, they were *not* essential to one's experience of the book [or lack thereof] - which implies a certain limit on the impact of book design on reading experience.
