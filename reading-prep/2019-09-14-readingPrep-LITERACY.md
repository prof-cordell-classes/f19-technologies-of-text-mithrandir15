# Reading Prep: LITERACY

#### David Polansky

## Questions or Observations

1. In "Speech Sounds", it's kept ambiguous how much of the violence is due to emotional/social impairment and how much is due to simple jealousy of literacy. It *seems* as though the violence wouldn't be so pervasive and indiscriminate without emotional/social impairment - which makes me wonder if the author meant to imply that a sudden lack of literacy would decapitate thinking, rather than shifting communication to a comprehensive sign language.

2. 
> Syllabics... both simplify writing and enable a vast increase in vocabulary." (The Book, p. 23)

 That it simplifies writing is obvious, but I'd like to see the justification for syllabics increasing vocabulary. Chinese didn't have romanizations (pinyin) until the late 19th century, but I'm not aware of their vocabulary being smaller than comparable Western languages.
 
3. How did the technological development in this chapter of The Book impact the common lengths of literary genres, if at all? I ask because, before codices, any modern-length novel would have to be recorded in at least dozens of volumes.
