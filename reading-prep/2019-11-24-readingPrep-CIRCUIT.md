# Reading Prep: CIRCUIT

## Questions or Observations

1. "What football will look like in the future" is probably the strangest vision of the future I've ever read, because so little changes in so much time. There are still soulless corporate office parks, Bluetooth connection issues, skinny jeans, and gross Burger King burgers. The presidency still appears to have term limits, despite the obvious utility of having an immortal leader with a proven track record. Law and Order is still the TV show of choice for (at least) one woman. I don't think Bois meant to seriously argue that people would eventually retreat to the world of their youth once immortality was secured - but I also don't know what his real purpose was. Maybe it was to seriously explore the endpoint of human plenty - various methods of staving off boredom - and using football as a convenient anchor point that we could relate to and he's familiar with.
2. New football is less watchable and less fun than both old football and geocaching. Its main affordance is that it takes up a lot of time. There's only so much progress you can make on foot in a day.
3. To summarize the reasons why Mod thinks he gravitates towards physical books:
	- Kindle books lack proper introduction
	- You can't see all your Kindle books at once, so the titles you want to read aren't brought to mind
	- Minor UI bugs that haven't been fixed
	- No long-term trust / emotional bond towards the Kindle
	- The medium's form is stagnant
	- Can't lend Kindle books to your friends
	
	I've also been buying physical books instead of Kindle books. (I don't have a Kindle, but I can read Kindle books on my laptop.) Mod's reasons make sense to me, but they're not intuitive - it doesn't seem like a difference in form should matter much to me, but it does. I *do* form emotional attachments with physical objects more than e-books. (Maybe Marie Kondo was right w/r/t objects having personalities.)
