# Reading Prep: TYPE

## Questions or Observations

1. "How typeface influences the way we read and think" fleshes out one of the reasons we're composing in Markdown - that your grading becomes less influenced by my aesthetic decisions. I wasn't aware that Baskerville and Georgia were seen as more "trustworthy" than other fonts, so I'll use them in essays for other classes going forward - even though that gives me an unearned leg-up over students who don't know that information. Markdown removes that advantage, and allows students to focus more on the content of their writing than the presentation.

2. What interested me about "Finding women in the printing shop" wasn't the presence of women in bookmaking, but the economy these women participated in. Six impressions of the book were made within three years, during which the copyright exchanged hands twice through business deals recorded by the Stationers' Registers. In the second deal, the copyright was loaned out for a moderate sum ([about $11,000 in today's money](https://www.uwyo.edu/numimage/currency.htm)). In the first deal, it's unclear what, if anything, was traded for the copyright, suggesting a less formal deal. But that's complicated by the clause "by Consent of a full Court" - why did the guild's "Court" need to consent? Was it standard procedure, was it a punitive measure, or was third-party arbitration necessary? The involvement of so many people suggests the profession had low barriers to entry, but there are so few details that a whole spectrum of transactions could plausibly have taken place.

3. In Chapter 7, Tristhimius implies that books can't be printed on parchment, only scribed:

> Who doesn't know how great is the distance between a scribed and a printed book? The scripture on parchment can persist a thousand years, but on paper, how long will it last? It's a great thing if a paper volume lasts two hundred years; but many are those who judge that their own texts ought to be printed.

This seems to contradict the readings' information about Gutenberg. He printed several of his eponymous Bibles on vellum, which is a kind of parchment. Gutenberg's press differed from later printing presses: in particular, "The Machine that Made Us" points out that his press could only print one page at a time. Was his press able to print on parchment, and others unable? Or were printing presses so entwined with paper-making that only scribes *would* use parchment? Or am I missing something else entirely?
