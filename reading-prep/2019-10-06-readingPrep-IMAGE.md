## Questions or Observations

1. Reading Copy A of *A Marriage of Heaven and Hell*, I tended to skip over the in-line illustrations. They were all the same color, and I felt they were simply interesting ways to do line breaks. Copy D, however, had a lot more variation of color, differentiating the illustrations from the text and making it much easier to see what the illustrations represented. We also integrate illustrations into our text (see: GIFs, emojis), but they're not nearly as integrated with the text as Blake's hand-drawn images: an emoji implicitly refers to other uses of that emoji, while these images don't have that burden (and can refer more directly to what they represent).
2. Carrión's definition of a book as a "sequence of space" or a "space-time sequence" is, as Borsuk says, "a definition so porous as to allow any number of objects or artifacts we might think of as books" (143). In fact, it's porous enough to allow legions of objects *no one* thinks of as books (including those that Borsuk mentions, a deck of cards and a sequence of rooms). A movie is a book, and so is a 5-second commercial. "For sale: baby shoes, never worn" is a book. printf("Hello, world!"); is a book. The "Yanny / Laurel" audio file is a book. If I'm interpreting the definition correctly, even a *disconnected* space-time sequence is a book: I could point to a random image, then a random ASCII character, then a random audio file, and by Carrión's definition I've identified a pre-existing book. Carrión resists using his own term for this ridiculously broad category, or even using a pre-existing term that fits the definition better (like "message", "text", or even "work of art"). I realize that the category of "book" is fuzzy and has shifted over time, but making the definition so broad is at odds with how people use the book, and makes the argument that *book* books should be thought of in the same way as any other "space-time sequence".
3. What does it mean for a book to be "democratic"? Borsuk says the democratic multiple was meant to "sever the barrier between high and low culture that [galleries] were supposed to represent" (135). Is reducing the cost and bypassing the gallery system sufficient to sever this barrier? Ruscha's books ended up increasing in price because high culture afforded the books that status. But even if the price hadn't increased, I don't think economic barriers are the only relevant barriers - there are also intellectual and cultural barriers [that might prevent *just anyone* from enjoying a given work of art]. I'm partly thinking of abstract art, whose inscrutability has been a meme for decades. I'm also thinking of music and literature that are incomprehensible if you don't already know what the artist is talking about (and which Genius, Annotated Shakespeare, etc. are responsible for unlocking). I think the correct response here is that intellectual and cultural "barriers" also elevate the work itself, but monetary barriers don't - so it's not desirable to make art without the former, only to make tools (like Genius) that help break them down.
